# Facebook News Feed Clone with Vanilla JS & TailwindCSS

Not a facebook clone but a news feed clone, You can add a post, like it and comment on it.

I think these are the core features of a news feed component.

I will add user auth later because that's as important as these features.

Stay tuned for upcoming features.

After I learn react, I will build a huge facebook clone app with more cool features, Vanilla is a little bit limited. ðŸ˜‰
